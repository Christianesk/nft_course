# NFT 101 COURSE

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
### Config environments

Create `.env` file in root folder and insert this:

```
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
MUMBAI_RPC=https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com/
```
